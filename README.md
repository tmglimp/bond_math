### Bond Math ###

SIFMA/ISDA standardized no-arbitrage formulas for prices, rate sensitivities, bond/forward equivalences, implied volatilies given historical data, and primative forwards derived from 0s/0 vols. 
A special credit is due to Mr. Victor Irechukwu for assisting with some of the interest rate measures and for the price-to-yield equation. He came up with the numerical method under the hood.
