### Bond Math ###

SIFMA/ISDA standardized no-arbitrage formulas for prices, rate sensitivities, bond/forward equivalences, and implied volatilies given historical data. 
There is also a stationary HJM term-structure rate model for deriving primative forwards derived from 0s/0 vols in an excel template. One could Always record a macro if they wanted to use this for PCA with CTD baskets. 
A special credit is due to Mr. Victor Irechukwu for assisting with some of the interest rate measures and for the price-to-yield equation. He came up with the numerical method under the hood.
